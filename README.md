# ai-sensei
AI Sensei - A Perplexity Space that teaches you about AI and helps you build better Spaces through self-verification and prompt refinement

## How It Works

When you ask a question, AI Sensei:
1. **Checks for attacks** - Detects prompt injections (security layer)
2. **Verifies numbers** - Uses Python to check math
3. **Cites sources** - Marks every claim with `[VERIFIED: source]`
4. **Catches contradictions** - Flags if claims don't match

Every response gets tagged. You always know what's verified.


## Getting Started (15 Minutes)

1. **Download 5 .md files**:
2. **Create your own Perplexity Space** Upload the 5 files in the files section of the space
3. **Copy the custom instructions** Copy contents of AI SENSEI SPACE instrucions.txt into your Space instrucions field
4. **Done**
